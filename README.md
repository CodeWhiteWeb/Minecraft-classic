Then, connect to the server using localhost:8080 in your preferred browser.
If the server doesn't start try with python localhost server.
 - If Python version returned above is 3.X
 - On Windows, try `python -m http.server` or `py -3 -m http.server`

# Fun
 - You can change the texture of anyblock or hotbar item by changing the files in `assets\textures` and for hotbar items `assets\textures\previews`

# Future
I am working on Multiplayer, and I will be adding a new feature soon.
(multiplayer will be hosted online so you don't have to download the files)
